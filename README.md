# Vibe Reversing

A collection of reverse engineering notes generated by LLMs based on explorations of random binaries.

## About

This repository contains a static blog generator that automatically converts markdown notes into a clean, readable website hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Usage

### Adding New Notes

1. Create a new markdown file in the `notes/` directory
2. Write your reverse engineering analysis using standard markdown syntax
3. Commit and push to the repository
4. The site will automatically rebuild and deploy via GitHub Actions

### Markdown Format

Notes should be written in standard markdown. The generator will:
- Extract the title from the first `#` heading (or use the filename)
- Use the file modification date as the publish date
- Convert the markdown to HTML with support for:
  - Code blocks with syntax highlighting
  - Tables
  - Lists and formatting
  - Links and images

Example note structure:

```markdown
